      <!-- วิธีทำ -->
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a wok or frying pan on
          high-medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the oil is hot and sizzling, drop in the egg. Let it sizzle and
          bubble up, and at the same time, splash some of the hot oil onto the
          top of the egg (don't flip the egg, unless you really want to).
        </li>
        <li>
          After the egg looks about right to your cooked likeness (I like mine
          runny), take it out, drain the excess oil, and put it on a plate for
          later.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the chicken into small bite sized pieces.</li>
        <li>
          Rinse and peel the garlic and chilies, and pound them in a mortar and
          pestle (alternatively you can just mince them with a knife). They
          don't need to be super fine, you just want to bring out the oils and
          flavors from the garlic and chilies.
        </li>
        <li>Pluck a good sized handful of holy basil leaves off the stems.</li>
        <li>
          Now it's time to start cooking. Heat your wok on high heat, and add
          about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the oil is hot, add the chilies and garlic. Stir fry them for
          about 20 seconds or so until they get really fragrant, but don't let
          them burn or get too dry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toss in your chicken. Keep stir frying continuously. At this stage you
          want to continue to stir and cook your chicken until it's just about
          fully cooked all the way through (depending on the size pieces of
          chicken and how hot your fire is, it should take about 2 - 3 minutes).
          If it starts to get dry, add just a tiny splash of water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce, ½ teaspoon light soy sauce, ½ teaspoon
          sugar, and finally a splash of dark soy sauce. Keep stir frying for
          about another 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grab a handful of holy basil, toss it into the pan, fold it into the
          chicken, and then immediately turn off the heat (if you're using an
          electric stove, you'll want to remove the pan from the burner). The
          holy basil really only needs to cook for about 5 seconds, and it will
          continue to wilt and cook from the existing heat of the chicken. This
          step is important because if you cook the basil for too long, it loses
          some of its glorious flavor and gets slightly chewy.
