        Pad see ew (ผัดซีอิ๊ว) is a widely popular fried noodle dish in
        Thailand. The wide rice noodles are combined with Chinese broccoli,

      <!-- วิธีทำ -->
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Comb through the fresh wide rice noodles, making sure any clumps are
          separated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel then mince 3 cloves of garlic, slice the chicken into small bite
          sized pieces, and slice the Chinese broccoli into 1.5 centimeter
          strips.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the wok (or frying pan) on a medium heat and add about 2
          tablespoons of oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wait until the oil is hot, and then fry the garlic for about 10
          seconds or so, making sure it sizzles in the hot oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the chopped chicken to the wok and stir fry for it about a minute
          until the chicken is nearly all the way white in color and cooked
          pretty well though and through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, turn down your heat (or if you’re using an electric stove you can
          even move your pan off the burner for a moment).
        </li>
        <li>
          Toss in the rice noodles, the Chinese broccoli, 1 tablespoon of light
          soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of dark soy sauce, and a ½ teaspoon of sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Still on low heat, start to fold the noodles gently by picking them up
          with the spatula from the bottom, and folding them over (If you stir
          fry too hard, the stickiness from the noodles can make them turn into
          a big noodle blob - believe me, I’ve done this too many times and it’s
          not pretty!).
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the noodles for about 1 -2 minutes. If it gets a little dry, you
          can drizzle in a tiny bit of oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the noodles are well mixed, scoot the noodles to one side of the
          wok, and proceed to crack an egg into the empty side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now it’s time to crank up the heat on your stove - for the final step
          we want a little char on the noodles and egg for great flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scramble the egg, and then fold the noodles onto the egg, sort of when
          it's half cooked. Let the heat sear the egg for a few seconds and then
          start folding the noodles and egg together. With a hot flaming fire,
          you should get a little char to both the noodles and the egg.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry for about 30 more seconds, making sure to be gentle with the
          noodles, and then turn off the heat and dish it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle a little freshly ground pepper on the top of the noodles. You
          can also eat pad see ew with a bit of chili flakes on top and some
          vinegar for taste.
        </li>
