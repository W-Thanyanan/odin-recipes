      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="description-text">
        Thai fried rice with shrimp (khao pad goong ข้าวผัดกุ้ง), is a very
        typical Thai street food dish, available at all stir fry restaurants.
        Though you can order the dish with your choice of meat, shrimp is the
        most popular option. What really makes Thai fried rice unique, is that
        it's served with a squeeze of lime on top to give it a nice sour tinge,
        and always accompanied by prik nam pla (พริกน้ำปลา), the Thai condiment
        of chilies and fish sauce. Enjoy this recipe for Thai fried rice!

        <ul>
          <li>
            1.5 cups of cooked Jasmine rice cooled (or day old rice works well
            too) - Or just estimate about 1 normal bowl full
          </li>
          <li>About 5 - 10 shrimp, head peeled, but tail on</li>
          <li>

            used)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 leaf of Chinese broccoli (or any crisp green leafy vegetable)
          </li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
          <li>1 egg</li>

          <li>½ tablespoon oyster sauce</li>

      <section class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p class="step-text">Fried Rice</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you’re using whole fresh shrimp like I did, first pinch off the
            head, and peel the outer shell of the shrimp, leaving only the tail
            on (that’s Thai style). You can also devein them if you’d like, but
            for small shrimp, to me it doesn’t really matter.
          </li>
          <li>Peel 2 cloves of garlic, and then just finely mince them</li>
          <li>Slice ¼ of a sweet white onion into medium sized strips</li>
          <li>Finely dice about 3 - 4 green onions</li>
          <li>
            Take just 1 leaf of Chinese broccoli (kai-lan), slice it in half
            first along the spine, and then slice it into 1 centimeter sized
            strips
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn on your stove to medium high, heat up your wok (or frying pan),
            and add about 1 tablespoon of oil Once your oil is hot, add the
            garlic first, and stir fry continuously for about 15 seconds or so,
            until it gets nice and fragrant
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your oil is hot, add the garlic first, and stir fry
            continuously for about 15 seconds or so, until it gets nice and
            fragrant
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, toss in your shrimp, and fry for about 30 seconds - your
            shrimp should start to turn pink and feel more firm
          </li>
          <li>
            Add in a little less than ½ of your rice first. This is going to
            soak up all those delicious shrimp juices and oils and keep your
            rice nice and dry. Stir fry for about 10 more seconds - This is a
            little known trick to make good rice, so it remains nice and dry
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoot all your rice to one side of the pan, and then crack in the
            egg into the empty side
          </li>
          <li>
            Whirl the egg up, let it cook for a few seconds, and then start to
            mix it up with the rice and shrimp
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep stir frying for about 20 seconds until the egg is fully cooked,
            and then add in the rest of your rice, and give it a quick stir
          </li>
          <li>
            Add ½ tablespoon of soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of oyster sauce, just a
            pinch of sugar (optional), and continue stir frying your rice,
            making sure all the sauce get mixed in
          </li>
          <li>
            Then add your chopped Chinese broccoli and onions, and stir fry for
            another 30 seconds until the vegetables wilt, but they can still be
            crisp and not fully cooked
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, toss in your green onions, stir it a few more seconds, and
            it’s ready
          </li>
          <li>Immediately dish your fried rice onto a plate</li>
          <li>
            Slice off a wedge of lime, and serve it on the plate next to the
            rice
          </li>
          <li>
            For the final touch, I like to sprinkle some freshly ground black
            pepper on top to give some extra flavor
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="step-text">Prik Nam Pla (Chilies in Fish Sauce)</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Add 3 tablespoons of fish sauce to a small bowl</li>
          <li>
            Slice about 5 Thai chilies (you can add more or less, up to you),
            and add them to the fish sauce
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, I like it with a little squeeze of about ½ of a lime - but
            this is optional - and at many Thai restaurants it’s only fish sauce
            and chilies
          </li>
          <li>That’s is, give it a stir, and set it aside</li>
        </ol>
